[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/4d099084aab34a57893e8fd29df79ae3)](https://www.codacy.com/app/gameontext/gameon-room-java?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=gameontext/gameon-room-java&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

[Game On!](https://game-on.org/) is both a sample microservices application, and a throwback text adventure brought to you by the WASdev team at IBM. This application demonstrates how microservice architectures work from two points of view:

1. As a Player: navigate through a network/maze of rooms. Each room is an autonomous service, supports chat, and may provide interaction with items (some of which may be in the room, some of which might be separately defined services as well).
2. As a Developer: learn about microservice architectures and their supporting infrastructure by creating your own microservices to extend the game.

You can learn more about Game On! at [http://game-on.org/](http://game-on.org/).

## Introduction

This walkthrough will guide you through creating and deploying a microservice that adds a simple room to the running Game On! microservices application.  You will be shown how to setup a room that is implemented in the Java programming language using Websphere Liberty and (a) deployed as a Cloud Foundry application in Bluemix, or (b) as a docker container that can be run locally or published to the IBM Container Service in Bluemix. 

This was done for this room, which is currently available via Bluemix and can be found in Game On!

### Installation prerequisites

For local development: 

- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
- Java 8: Any compliant JVM should work.
  * [Java 8 JDK from Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
  * [Java 8 JDK from IBM (AIX, Linux, z/OS, IBM i)](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/),  
    or [Download a Liberty server package](https://developer.ibm.com/assets/wasdev/#filter/assetTypeFilters=PRODUCT)
    that contains the IBM JDK (Windows, Linux)

For deployment to Bluemix:

- [Bluemix account](https://console.ng.bluemix.net)
- [IBM DevOps Services Account](https://hub.jazz.net/register)
- [GitHub account](https://github.com/)

### Create Bluemix accounts and log in

Sign up for Bluemix at https://console.ng.bluemix.net and DevOps Services at https://hub.jazz.net. When you sign up, you'll create an IBM ID, create an alias, and register with Bluemix.
* Make a note of your username and org, as you will need both later.
  * By default, the space is dev and the org is the project creator's user name. For example, if sara@example.com signs in to Bluemix for the first time, the active space is dev and the org is sara@example.com.

## Registering your room

Microservices in production should support automatic scaling, with multiple instances of the room microservice running in parallel, with new instances starting or existing instances stopping at unpredictable times.  As a result of this, the room does not programmatically register itself by default. You can force it to do so by specifying the GAMEON_ID and GAMEON_SECRET environment variables.

The preferred way to register a room is via the Edit Rooms dialog in Game On! (note you can also use the [command line regutil tool](https://github.com/gameontext/regutil) or the [interactive map](https://game-on.org/interactivemap)).

1.  Go to [GameOn](https://game-on.org) and sign in.
2.  Once you are signed in, go to the top right of the browser window and click on your username (or person icon).
3.  From this window, again click the top right panel to select **Edit rooms**.
4.  Under **Select or create a room**, make sure **create a room** is selected from the dropdown.
5.  Fill in the room information as specified. If you don't know all the details yet, such as endpoint, leave those blank and come back and fill them in later.
6.  Click **Create** and the room will be created for you.

## Getting the source code

The source code is located in GitHub, navigate to our [repository](https://github.com/gameontext/gameon-room-java.git) and download the ZIP file and unzip the code on to your local machine. Alternatively you can use the GitHub CLI to clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/gameontext/gameon-room-java.git`.

## Build and deploy

### Deploying to Bluemix as a Cloud Foundry app

1. `cd gameon-room-java`
2. `mvn install`
  After running this, you will have the server running locally at [http://localhost:9080/](http://localhost:9080/).
  You can use a browser extension to play with the WebSocket according to the
  [Game On! WebSocket protocol](https://book.game-on.org/microservices/WebSocketProtocol.html).

  Use `mvn clean -P stopServer` to stop the server.

3. Use a maven target profile to push the app to Bluemix: (enter the below as one maven command)
```
mvn install -P bluemix
    -Dcf.org=<your bluemix organization>
    -Dcf.username=<bluemix username>
    -Dcf.password=<bluemix password>
    -Dapp.name=<cf-app-name>
```

After your room has been pushed, your WebSocket should be specified as `ws://<cf-app-name>.eu-gb.mybluemix.net/room` (see the additional notes below).

**Please Note:** If you want to register your room directly from here you can do this by setting the following additional properties:
```
    -Dgameon.id=<Your Game On! ID>
    -Dgameon.secret=<Your Game On! Shared Secret>
```


#### Additional notes:

* `app.name` is a unique, URL-friendly name for your deployed Bluemix app.
* `gameon.id` and `gameon.secret` are those retrieved [earlier](https://github.com/cfsworkload/gameon-room-java#get-game-on-id-and-shared-secret).
* Advanced: if you have an existing Bluemix account or require different Bluemix settings, you can set them on the command line. The default values that are applied:
  * `cf.space=dev`
  * Note values go in pairs for target and context:
    * London (default):
      * `cf.context=eu-gb.mybluemix.net`
      * `cf.target=https://api.eu-gb.bluemix.net`
    * US South:
      * `-Dcf.target=https://api.ng.bluemix.net`
      * `-Dcf.context=mybluemix.net`

### Deploy using Docker

#### Deploying locally

It is possible to deploy your room locally into a Docker container. This can be useful if you want to test aspects such as the room registration and configuration retrieval. Remember, this room will be running locally on your hardware so Game On will not be able to access it, unless your machine is also publicly accessible.

##### Installation prerequisites

1. [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
2. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

##### Deploying

Once docker is installed, then you deploy your room with

* `mvn package -P docker` to build your room.
* Create a file called `docker-compose.override.yml` which contains the folllowing
```
gojava:
 volumes:
   - './gojava-application/target/dropins:/opt/ibm/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer/dropins'
```
* `docker-compose build`
* `docker-compose up -d`

After this you will have a docker container with your room, running Liberty, and listening on port 9080. A note about `docker-compose.override.yml`, this is an override file that can be used to change, or add to, an existing docker build file. In this case, it maps the file system on the local machine into the dropins directory for the Liberty server running inside the container. The end result is that if you make some changes to your code and run `mvn package -P docker` again to rebuild your war file, then Liberty will see that the file has changed and automatically reload your room without having to build or restart the container.

##### Debugging your room

It is possible to attach a debugger to your room so that you can set breakpoints and step through code. Add the following lines to the `docker-compose.override.yml` file

```
ports:
 - "7777:7777"
environment:
 - LIBERTY_MODE: debug
```

The `ports` section instructs docker to expose the port 7777 from inside the container, so that the debugger can attach. The `environment` statement sets an environment variable called `LIBERTY_MODE` to debug. This variable is read by the Liberty startup script and controls how the server is started, in this case in debug mode.

#### Deploying to Bluemix with IBM Container Services

##### Installation prerequisites

1. [Cloud foundry API](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases)
2. [Install the IBM COntainers plugin](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/containers/container_cli_cfic_install.html)

##### Deploying

1. Log in to the IBM container service. This needs to be done in two stages:
  1. Log into the Cloud Foundry CLI using `cf login`. Ypu will need to specify the API endpoint as `api.ng.bluemix.net` for the US South server, or `api.eu-gb.bluemix.net` for the UK server.
  2. After this run the command `cf ic login`. This will perform the authentication to the IBM Container Service.
2. Build the container in the Bluemix registry by running the command  `cf ic build -t gojava .` from inside the `gojava-wlpcfg` directory.
3. Run `cf ic images` and check your image is available.
4. Start the container by running the command `cf ic run -p 9080 --name gojava <registry>/<namespace>/gojava`. You can find the full path from the output of `cf ic images`. An example would be:

  `cf ic run -p 9080 --name gojava registry.ng.bluemix.net/pavittr/gojava`

5. While you are waiting for the container to start, request a public IP address using the command `cf ic ip request`. This will return you a public IP address you can bind to your container.
6. With the returned IP address, bind it using the command `cf ic ip bind <ip address> gojava`.
7. Issue `cf ic ps`, and wait for your container to go from "Networking" to "Running".
8. Now you can go to `http://<ip address>:9080` and access the Liberty welcome page.
  
#### Deploy as a container group

Instead of deploying a container as a single instance, you can instead deploy a container group. A container group can be used to deploy multiple instances of the same container and load balance between them.

1. Log in to the IBM container service. This needs to be done in two stages:
  1. Log into the Cloud Foundry CLI using `cf login`. Ypu will need to specify the API endpoint as `api.ng.bluemix.net` for the US South server, or `api.eu-gb.bluemix.net` for the UK server.
  2. After this run the command `cf ic login`. This will perform the authentication to the IBM Container Service.
2. Run `cf ic images` and check the `gojava` image is available. If not, run the command `cf ic build -t gojava .` from inside the `gojava-wlpcfg` directory to create it.
3. Create the container group by running `cf ic group create -p 9080 -n <appName> --name gojavagroup <registry>/<namespace>/gojava`. You can find the full path from the output of `cf ic images`. An example would be:

  `cf ic group create -p 9080 --name gojavagroup registry.ng.bluemix.net/pavittr/gojava`

4. Run the command ` cf ic route map -n <appHost> -d mybluemix.net  gojavagroup`. This will make your containers available at <appHost>.mybluemix.net.
5. Run the command `cf ic group instances gojavagroup` to check the status of your instances. Once they are in "Running" state your group is ready to use.
6. Now you can go to `http://<appHost>.mybluemix.net` and access the Liberty welcome page.

## Access room on Game On!

Once the room is set up and it has registered with Game On!, it will be accessible on [Game On!](https://game-on.org/). It may take a moment for the room to appear.

1. Log in to [Game On!](https://game-on.org/) using the authentication method you used to create your user ID and shared secret for the registered room.
2. Use the Game On! command `/listmyrooms` from The First Room, to see your list of rooms. Once your room is registered, it will appear in that list.
3. To get to your room, navigate through the network or go directly there by using the `/teleport` command from The First Room.
4. Look at the Bluemix log console to see "A new connection has been made to the room"

Congratulations, you've deployed a microservice that extended an existing microservices-based application so that it can do something new.

Suggested activities:
* Make it more resilient -- add additional instances using the autoscaling add-on: https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/auto-scaling
* Consider how to allow chat messages to propagate between independent instances using a shared datastore or cache, or an event bus, or...


### List of host provided commands

The Game On! host provides a set a universal commands:
- **/exits** - List of all exits from the current room.
- **/help** - List of all available commands for the current room.
- **/sos** - Go back to The First Room.

### The First Room commands

The First Room is usually where new users will start in Game On!. From there, additional commands are available and maintained by Game On!. For the list of current commands use the `/help` command.
